        <p>
          I've always loved to decorate and make things beautiful. I baked with my mom when I was little. I also painted and drew pictures. It had to be when I took my first baking job that I knew this was what I was meant to do. I like to make people smile with
          my cakes. What cake can I make for you? You dream it I'll make it. Thank you for visiting my site I look forward to the opportunity to make you Smile!
