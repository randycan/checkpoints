      <p>
        I've always loved to decorate and make things beautiful.
I baked with my mom when I was little. I also painted and drew pictures. It had to be when I took my first baking job that I knew this was what I was meant to do.
I like to make people smile with my cakes. What  cake can I make for you?  You dream it I'll make it. Thank you for visiting my site I look forward to the opportunity to make you Smile!
